Final project assignment 

My .html file is still under way with only certain parts completed.
In the end I should have around four to five pages total. 
I have only finished pages one and two currently working on the rest.
The first pages is just a heading where it says a phrase to catch attention. 
The second page is asking why you should choose the company.
The third page is going to be about the services offered.
The fourth section is showing where they could follow our work and will involve pictures of previous jobs. 
The last section is how they can contact the company. 

My .css file has not been started yet.
I want to complete most of my .html file before I begin my CSS. 
But I do have an idea of what I am going to apply to my CSS file.
